  abstract = {TracTrac is an open-source Matlab/Python implementation of a robust and efficient object tracking algorithm capable of simultaneously tracking several thousands of objects in very short time. Originally developed as an alternative to particle image velocimetry algorithms for estimating fluid flow velocities, its versatility and robustness makes it relevant to many other dynamic sceneries encountered in geophysics such as granular flows and drone videography. In this article, the structure of the algorithm is detailed and its capacity to resolve strongly variable and intermittent object motions is tested against three examples of geophysical interest.}

  abstract = {We describe a set of image processing algorithms for extracting quantitative data from digitized video microscope images of colloidal suspensions. In a typical application, these direct imaging techniques can locate submicrometer spheres to within 10 nm in the focal plane and 150 nm in depth. Combining information from a sequence of video images into single-particle trajectories makes possible measurements of quantities of fundamental and practical interest such as diffusion coefficients and pair-wise interaction potentials. The measurements we describe in detail combine the outstanding resolution of digital imaging with video-synchronized optical trapping to obtain highly accurate and reproducible results very rapidly.}

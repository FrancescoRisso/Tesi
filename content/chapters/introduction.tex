\section{Particle tracking}

Thanks to the existence of the Earth's atmosphere, we live in an enormous fish bowl, filled to the brim with air.
In our everyday life, we constantly perceive this mass of air: for instance we breathe it, we are subjected to the atmospheric pressure, we see insects flying through it, as if they were swimming.

Sometimes we can perceive that this giant mass is moving, for example when there is a slight breeze blowing on us.
This may lead curious people to desire to understand deeply how and why this movement happens.

Since air is transparent, we cannot base our research on observing it.
The tactile feelings are not enough, either, since we are only able to perceive movements of a certain strength.
We can however leverage our good vision to observe small particles floating in the air: they move with the surrounding, but unlike the air, we can see them.

Directly obserbing the particles can be a starting point to understand the air movement.
However, this method lacks the possibility to ``pause'' the time to reflect, and the possibility to rollback the observation to check what has just happened.
The most common solution to this problem is to record the observation with cameras, to be able to pause and rewatch the footage.
However, a simple 2D recording cannot encode the essential information about depth: for these applications, it is therefore crucial to capture the experiment in a way that allows to reconstruct the trajectories in full 3D.

While being easy for the human brain, the task of recreating a 3D scene from some 2D views is not trivial for an algorithm.
In my thesis, I had to try to accomplish it with good quality, with very stringent requirements about computation time.

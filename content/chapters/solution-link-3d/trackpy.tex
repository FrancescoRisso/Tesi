\subsection{Trackpy}
\label{sec:link3d:trackpy}

With minor modifications, it was possible to update the Trackpy \linkDD* (described in section~\ref{sec:link2d:trackpy}) for performing \linkDDD*.

\subsubsection{Algorithm}

The Trackpy library implements the Crocker-Grier linking algorithm~\cite{trackpy-link}.

\subsubsection{Evaluation}

The speed is similar to the Trackpy \linkDD* for one camera, at 38 FPS.
However, most of the tracklets were extremely short, resulting in about 9300 individual tracklet.

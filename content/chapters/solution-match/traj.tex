\subsection{Long trajectory}
\label{sec:match:traj}

The research group that commissioned this thesis was working in parallel on a way to estimate calibration data without the need of a calibration process.
Instead, the model developed tried to perform a \match* (without knowledge of the epilines), to infer the calibration data from it.
Since this task was in common among the two projects, their solution was also considered and evaluated for the scope our purpose.

\subsubsection{Algorithm}

The solution uses a Deep Learning model, Lightglue TODO, to match long trajectories seen from different cameras.
In particular, the model performed the match on a specific frame by looking at the 200-frames-long trajectories that started in the frame itself.

\subsubsection{Evaluation}

While this approach was useful in the complex situation of autocalibration, for our task it was too computationally intensive.
Indeed, the maximum speed obtainable with this approach was 3 FPS, too far from the target 30 FPS.

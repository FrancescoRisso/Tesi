\subsection{Brute force}
\label{sec:match:bruteforce}

This approach leverages the fact that more than two cameras are present, not only as a confirmation, but as a knowledge extracting method.

Given a bubble on the main camera, it should be matched to a specific bubble on the other two cameras.
If the 3D position is reconstructed from the main and one side camera, the result should be similar to the reconstuction done with the main and the other side camera.
On the other side, wrong matches would reconstruct totally different 3D coordinates.

\subsubsection{Algorithm}

\begin{enumerate}
	\itemsep 0em
	\item For each bubble in the main camera:
	      \begin{enumerate}
		      \item Reconstruct the 3D position matching it with all the bubbles on one side camera. The result will be a set of 3D points ($P_i$);
		      \item Do the same, with the other side camera (to obtain a set $P_j'$);
		      \item Find the points $p\in P_i$ and $p'\in P_j'$ that minimize their distance;
		      \item Check their distance:
		      \begin{itemize}
				\item If it is below a specific threshold, the two bubbles are considered the same, and the two matches are approved;
				\item Otherwhise, the reconstructed bubbles are the closest plausible, but still different bubbles, hence the match is considered missing.
			  \end{itemize}
	      \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Evaluation}

This approach was not evaluated directly, since a very simple addition could highly reduce its computational cost.
This algorithm was therefore only considered as starting idea for the approach described in the next paragraph.

\section{Resource usage}

A further test was conducted to measure the CPU usage of the device running the pipeline.
GPU usage was not measured, since the value would spike to 100\% as soon as there was any task running on it: the values would therefore not be indicative of whether other computations could be performed at the same time.
The CPU results are shown in figure~\ref{fig:usage}.

In the Jetson Orin Nano, all CPU cores are almost at 100\%, indicating that all resources are devolved to the task.
On the Jetson AGX Xavier, the situation is slightly different: the most notable fact is that the bottleneck shifts from the \locate* step to the \match*, and the overall processing speed is lower.
This is visible in the graph as a sudden de-loading of the device: when all steps are running, the full device is in use; after the \locate* finishes processing all the video, some cores reduce their usage.
This may be an indication that, being a more premium device, the Xavier is faster than the Orin at transferring data to the RAM; however the fact of being older penalyzes it on CPU computational speed.

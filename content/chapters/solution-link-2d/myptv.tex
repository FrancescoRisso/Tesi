\subsection{MyPTV}
\label{sec:link2d:myptv}

MyPTV~\cite{myptv} implements \linkDD* with the \texttt{2D\_tracking} command.

\subsubsection{Algorithm}

The library implements the ``best estimate method'' described by Ouellette-Xu~\cite{linkDD-myptv}: a nearest neighbor initial guess, followed by 4-frame tracking for the following frames.

\subsubsection{Evaluation}

The speed of this approach, lower than 1 FPS, was unacceptable: as such, the quality was not even evaluated.

\subsection{Kalman GPU}
\label{sec:link2d:kalman-gpu}

The Kalman CPU approach performs the same operation over all the bubbles of all the images.
A GPU implementation was therefore evaluated, to test its potential parallelization.

\subsubsection{Algorithm}

The algorithm is the same as the previous approach, with step 2 transformed into a GPU kernel.
This kernel processes all bubbles of all images captured at the same time instant.

\subsubsection{Evaluation}

The speed is quite faster than the Kalman CPU approach, but still considerably slower than Trackpy, standing at 68 FPS.
The quality is however worse: the number of tracklets increased to about 8900, and a visual inspection found some inconsistencies (in figure~\ref{fig:linkDD:kalmangpu}, two tracklets in the middle include an unreasonable jump).

\subsection{Torch.unfold concept}

The \texttt{unfold} function from \texttt{PyTorch} takes an image, and breaks it into either disjoint or partially overlapping tiles.
The idea is to use a divide and conquer approach, where the full image is split into smaller images, hopefully making it faster.


\subsubsection{Algorithm}

The overall algorithm divides the image into patches, to then process each one separately.
Different tile sizes were compared, to find the best, if any.

\subsubsection{Evaluation}

As visible in table~\ref{tab:torch.unfold}, having smaller patches increases the time required to perform the overall \textit{Locate}.
This is likely due to the overlap between patches.
The overlap is however necessary, to avoid bubbles split across patches to be considered as separate.

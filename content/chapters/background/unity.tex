\section{Unity}

Unity~\cite{unity} is a Game Engine, a software designed to help developers creating interactive applications --- including, but not limited to, games.
Unity natively supports the rendering of 3D geometries in real-time, while reacting to the user's inputs.
These characteristics made Unity the perfect tool to create a visualizer for the reconstructed 3D data.

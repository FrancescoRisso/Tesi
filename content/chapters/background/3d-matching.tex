\subsection{3D matching}

For estimating the depth, \texttt{triangulatePoints} needs matched point.
That is, the $i{-}th$ point provided by camera $A$ and the $i{-}th$ point provided by camera $B$ must be the two projections of the same 3D point.
To perform this matching, traditional stereoscopy follows this procedure:
\begin{enumerate}
	\itemsep 0em
	\item Choose a point in the main image;
	\item Compute the equation of the corresponding epiline;
	\item Consider a patch around the original point;
	\item For each point on the epiline (in the second image), compute the similarity of a patch centered in that point with the original patch;
	\item Select the most similar point as the match;
	\item Compute the 3D coordinate of the point from the obtained match.
\end{enumerate}

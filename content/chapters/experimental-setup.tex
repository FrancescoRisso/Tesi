During development, everything was tested on a Jetson Orin Nano, while a final benchmarking was also done ...

\section{Jetson Orin Nano}

The Jetson Orin Nano~\cite{jetson} is a compact but powerful system developed by NVIDIA.
It is powered by a 6-core Arm® Cortex®-A78AE v8.2 64-bit CPU.
It provides an 8GB, LPDDR5 RAM, and accepts an SD card and an external NVMe as mass storage.
It also features a NVIDIA GPU with Ampere architecture, that offers 1024 CUDA cores and 32 tensor cores.
The power consumption can oscillate between 7 and 25W: during our tests, it was always set to maximize performance.
